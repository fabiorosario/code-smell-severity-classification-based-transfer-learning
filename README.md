# An Approach for Code Smell Detection and Severity Assessment based on Transfer Learning
Code smell detection and severity assessment are important for categorizing and prioritizing software maintenance efforts. In this sense, there is considerable research focusing on Deep Learning and Transformer-based models for code smell detection. This work aims not only to detect but also to make a severity assessment of code smells using a two-stage approach employing Ensembles and Transfer Learning. This work also explores the impact of applying data scaling, feature selection techniques, hyperparameter optimization, and data oversampling to enhance the Ensembles for code smell detection and severity assessment. Moreover, the proposed approach works at the two code smell levels (class and method) and is suitable for both Java and C# datasets. This work reveals that Transfer Learning improved model generalization, with detection accuracy on the C# dataset matching or exceeding that of the Java dataset with minimal performance loss. Experiments indicate that the proposed approach delivers promising results for code smell detection and severity assessment at both class and method levels.
